# password-generator

## Description 
This project is an "On-the-job ticket" where I have to refactor existing code for this password generator. I have to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.     

## Installation

## Usage 
 This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
